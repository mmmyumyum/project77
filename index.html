        <h1>Console Project </h1>
        <p>
            To start a project such as a console project you first have to go into Visual Studio Code and here is how: 
            First, you must create a folder that you are going to put the project in.
            Then, when you in a new page choose the "Open Folder" option and click on your folder.
            Now, you can start to type your code but you have to create you HTML, CSS, and JS.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now lets say that you are doing a console project, but you want to know all about the console first.
            Well here it is:
            The console screen is where you can write and encode messages that are off the screen.
            You can do it by using the code "console.log()" in JS. 
            You can open up the console screen by right clicking and pressing "Inspect".
            Once your in the menu, you can click on Console and you will see you messages.
        </p>
        <script>
        console.log("Hello! This is my first console project.")
            var first_name = "Bryce";
            var last_name = "Luu";
            var full_name = first_name.concat(last_name);
            console.log(full_name)
            var a = 12;
            console.log(a)
            var b = 3;
            console.log(b)
            var add = a + b;
            console.log(add)
            var sub = a - b;
            console.log(sub)
            var multi = a * b;
            console.log(multi)
            var div = a / b;
            console.log(div)
        </script>
